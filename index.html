		<h1>Song</h1>
		<p>
		My silks and fine array,
		My smiles and languish'd air,
		By love are driv'n away;
		And mournful lean Despair
		Brings me yew to deck my grave;
		Such end true lovers have.
		</p>
		<p>
		His face is fair as heav'n
		When springing buds unfold;
		O why to him was't giv'n
		Whose heart is wintry cold?
		His breast is love's all-worshipp'd tomb,
		Where all love's pilgrims come.
		</p>
		<p>
		Bring me an axe and spade,
		Bring me a winding sheet;
		When I my grave have made
		Let winds and tempests beat:
		Then down I'll lie as cold as clay.
		True love doth pass away!
		</p>
